			<h3>Tubby's Name:</h3>
				<p>Tubby's original name was actually not Tubby! She started out as Tango, with her sister Cash. Because there were two kittens, when it came to feeding time, there would be two bowls set out. Whenever this happened, Tubby would run up to get to the food first, and when her sister would try and get to her own food, Tubby would notice and also push her out of the way at that bowl. This lead to her dad saying, "Hey, Tubby, get out of the way and let your sister eat!" And the name just kind of stuck. Her sister was also later on renamed to Babou, because she was wild! Very fitting, considering she chose to take off into the Forest a couple of years ago and become fully wild. We think she got sick of Tubby taking all of the food. We miss her.</p>

			<h2>A little about her...</h2>
				<p>Tubby is a very friendly cat who loves lots of backrubs & scritches. She is used to being a lone wolf at home so she gets lots of love and attention. She will often mew, chirp, and meow when your attention is not on her and she would like it, usually because she is calling you to perform a task for her. She has many different noises that mean different things.</p>
				<p>Tubby likes to spend her afternoons having a cat nap so that she can spend her evenings and nights outdoors. She enjoys frolicking outside and preying on small creatures, especially mice. If you are heading outside she will often follow you and keep you company whether you are just hanging out or doing some work, she will be there to oversee the action. Tubby loves to explore and if she sees a plant or flower she will go up to smell it. She also likes to go on car rides with her humans and explore new places.</p>
